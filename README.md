# Diabetes Prediction

    This project is part of the Computing for Health & Medicine course from University of Massachusetts, Lowell.

- Project Status: [Complete]

# Project Objective

    We will be predicting whether the patient has diabetes or not based on the features we will provide to our machine learning model. 

# Methods Used

    1. Data Pre-processing.
    2. Feature Extraction.  
    3. Machine Learning Models.
    4. Comparing accuracy of the different models used.

# Libraries

    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scikit-learn

# Dataset Source Description

    - Pregnancies
    - Glucose
    - BloodPressure	
    - SkinThickness	
    - Insulin	
    - BMI	
    - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
    - Age
    - Outcome

# Instructions

jupyter notebook Bikeshare_New.ipynb

    1. Open Terminal or Command Prompt, Enter the above line to open the jupyter notebook (Note: Both the Dataset and the Notebook has to be in the same folder)
    2. Once the Jupyter Notebook opens, you can run the Notebook and make appropriate changes.

# Machine Learning

    As the dataset has 2000 records, we will implementing our model in jupyter notebook.

    For building and training the model we have used four different classifiers, namely - Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier.

Out of the 4 classifiers, Random Forest Classifier and Bagging Classifier had the highest accuracy score compared to the rest of the algorithms.

# Evaluation

        Since we have implemented a classification model, we have evaluated our model using accuracy_score from sklearn as a primary metric.

# Conclusion

    We have built a classification model which can help detect Diabetes in earlier stage.
